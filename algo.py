# This is Final Project for course MIS 3500
# Project chosen for the Final project is '1'
# The project is based on Stock Market

# Pre-requisites of the Project
# 1. Getting Data from web JSON API
# 2. Storing data in CSV files
# 3. Auto-update
# 4. Three Analysis on the data
# 5. Results inside results.json

import requests  # three request library is used to use api to request for data
# path is called for checking if the file exists and that helps in calling different functions
from os import path
import time  # time library is used for the sleep to avoid api max out
import json  # json is called to be used for creating json file
API_KEY = 'NG9C9EPVYBMQT0C8'
# API KEY for the data

# RESOURCES USED:
# Class lectures
# Content Videos
# Old hw to get idea of dict syntax

# Library imports
# json import to handle the json files
# requests imported to handle API key
# wait for 1 sec
